## Future Enhancements

Some ideas for future improvements:

- Add music selection functionality
- Create reminder notifications for upcoming birthdays
- Add more sharing options (social media integrations)
-AI Integration (Text Generation):
 Users can input keywords (e.g., "John, pizza lover, marathon runner"), and the system will generate a personalized birthday wish using an AI model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar API).
 Use an AI model (e.g., GPT-3) to generate personalized birthday messages based on user input (e.g., "John, pizza lover, marathon runner").
