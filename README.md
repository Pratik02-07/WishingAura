WishingAura - Birthday Experience Platform
Welcome to the Birthday Experience Platform — an exciting website that allows users to create, personalize, and share unforgettable birthday wishes. This platform gives users the power to create fully customizable birthday wishes using templates, photos, text, and optional music and animations. Scheduled wishes can be sent to friends and family, along with the ability to share personalized links.

Features
Core Features:
Template Selection:

Users can choose from a variety of birthday wish templates (e.g., romantic, funny, emotional).

Photo Upload:

Users can upload their own photos to customize their birthday wishes (e.g., selfies, shared memories).
- Supports up to 5 photos per wish
- Maximum file size: 5MB per photo
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, HEIC
- Images are automatically optimized and delivered via CDN
- Secure direct uploads to Cloudinary

Text Customization:

Users can write custom birthday messages or personalize them by providing keywords (e.g., "John, pizza lover, marathon runner").

Add Music (Optional):

Users can choose a background song for their birthday wish or upload their own music file.

Animations and Effects:

Beautiful animations like confetti, cake, or fireworks can be added to make the birthday wish magical.

Scheduled Delivery:

Users can schedule when the birthday wish should be delivered (e.g., on the person's birthday at 9 AM).

Share Options:

After wish creation, users can share the wish via:
- WhatsApp
- Email
- Instagram

- TinyURL (Auto-generated short links for easy sharing)

Auto-generated short links like bdayblast.com/John23 for easy sharing.

Future Enhancements:
AI Text Generator (Future Feature):

Users can input keywords (e.g., "John, pizza lover, marathon runner"), and the system will generate a personalized birthday wish using an AI model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar API).

Credits System (Future Enhancement):s

Users will have access to free basic templates.

Special templates (e.g., golden design, animated videos) will cost credits.

Users can earn credits by inviting friends or purchase them later.

Future Development
